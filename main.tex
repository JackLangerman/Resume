% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

% Contracted to design novel techniques/algorithms and explore system architectures for applying deep learning and neural network based methods to centimeter level robotic / device localization via computer vision and sensor fusion in 5th generation cellular equipped environments.


Spearhead monocular vision based localization at Bell Labs; design and implement novel techniques, algorithms, and system architectures for precise (cm level) deep learning based camera pose estimation; create framework, road-map, underlying code-base, documentation and cloud infrastructure; and oversee deployment of PoC in customer facing demo facility. Mentor summer + fall interns (UG-PhD.). Improve 3d capture rate by 100x. Focus on generalization from simulation to the real world and avoiding the need for labels in monocular vision/point sets,  RF, and multi-sensory data. Patent filed for "Positioning w/ Ch. State Info. Using MIMO Conv. Autoencoder" (paper at \href{https://www.ion.org/plans/abstracts.cfm?paperID=8295}{IEEE/ION PLANS}).

% ML lead under PI Yao Wang on research collaboration between Viacom and NYU Video Lab facilitated by NYC Media Lab. Representation Learning for large unstructured multimodal data (TV Shows) -NLP / Transformer based; as well as several downstream tasks including hierarchical multilabel classification with several thousand classes and noisy labels, as well as ranking, recommendation, retrieval and visualization.  

% Previous project focused on Deep Learning for 3D volumetric semantic segmentation for medical images. Responsible for design and implementation of novel techniques for medical image analysis and pattern recognition. Designed and implemented novel Neural Network / Deep Learning based pipeline to segment brain ventricles from 3D ultrasound scans of embryonic mice which outperformed the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.

- Deep Representation Learning for TV Shows: ML lead under PI Yao Wang on research collaboration (Viacom/NYU Video Lab/NYC Media Lab). Design and implement novel pipeline using state of the art Transformer models leveraging large unsupervised corpora as well as small labeled data to learn general representations for several downstream tasks including hierarchical multi-label classification (1k+ noisy labels), as well as ranking, recommendation, retrieval, and visualization.

Novel Neural Network / Deep Learning based pipeline outperformed the previous state-of-the-art for 3D ultrasound scans of embryonic mice by a margin of 25\% (\href{https://www.ieeespmb.org/2018/papers/l02_04.pdf}{IEEE SPMB}). Follow up work improved accuracy+explainability (IEEE IUS), and speed by 1000x (IEEE ISBI).
